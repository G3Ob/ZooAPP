        <h3>Lion</h3>
        <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Africa and India. It has a muscular,
            broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually
            dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming
            groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female
            lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator;
            although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, lions typically
            do not actively seek out and prey on humans.</p>

        <h3>Elephant</h3>
        <p>Elephants are the largest living land animals. Three living species are currently recognised: the African bush
            elephant (Loxodonta africana), the African forest elephant (L. cyclotis), and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus).
            They are the only surviving members of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea; extinct relatives include
            mammoths and mastodons. Distinctive features of elephants include a long proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear
            flaps, pillar-like legs, and tough but sensitive grey skin. The trunk is prehensile, bringing food and water to the
            mouth and grasping objects. Tusks, which are derived from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for
            moving objects and digging. The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication.
            African elephants have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.</p>

    <h2>Birds</h2>
    <div class="animal">
        <h3>Parrot</h3>
        <p>Parrots (Psittaciformes), also known as psittacines (/ˈsɪtəsaɪnz/),[1][2] are birds with a strong curved beak, upright
            stance, and clawed feet.[a] They are conformed by four families that contain roughly 410 species in 101 genera, found
            mostly in tropical and subtropical regions. The four families are the Psittaculidae (Old World parrots), Psittacidae
            (African and New World parrots), Cacatuoidea (cockatoos), and Strigopidae (New Zealand parrots). One-third of all parrot
            species are threatened by extinction, with a higher aggregate extinction risk (IUCN Red List Index) than any other
            comparable bird group.[3] Parrots have a generally pantropical distribution with several species inhabiting temperate
            regions as well. The greatest diversity of parrots is in South America[4] and Australasia.</p>

    <div class="animal">
        <h3>Ostrich</h3>
        <p>Ostriches are large flightless birds. They are the heaviest and largest living birds, with adult common ostriches weighing
            anywhere between 63.5 and 145 kilograms and laying the largest eggs of any living land animal.[3] With the ability to run
            at 70 km/h (43.5 mph),[4] they are the fastest birds on land. They are farmed worldwide, with significant industries in the
            Philippines and in Namibia. Ostrich leather is a lucrative commodity, and the large feathers are used as plumes for the decoration
            of ceremonial headgear. Ostrich eggs have been used by humans for millennia.</p>

        <h3>Crocodile</h3>
        <p>Crocodiles (family Crocodylidae) or true crocodiles are large semiaquatic reptiles that live throughout the tropics in Africa,
            Asia, the Americas and Australia. The term crocodile is sometimes used even more loosely to include all extant members of the
            order Crocodilia, which includes the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), the gharial and false gharial (family Gavialidae)
            among other extinct taxa.</p>

    <div class="animal">
        <h3>Snake</h3>
        <p>Snakes are elongated, limbless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes (/sɜːrˈpɛntiːz/).[2] Like all other squamates,
            snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. Many species of snakes have skulls with several
            more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads (cranial kinesis). To
            accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side,
            and most have only one functional lung. Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca.
            Lizards have independently evolved elongate bodies without limbs or with greatly reduced limbs at least twenty-five times via convergent
            evolution, leading to many lineages of legless lizards.[3] These resemble snakes, but several common groups of legless lizards have
            eyelids and external ears, which snakes lack, although this rule is not universal (see Amphisbaenia, Dibamidae, and Pygopodidae).</p>
